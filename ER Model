Entity Relationship Model(ER model)

Entity-Relationship (ER) model is a visual representation of the tableâ€™s structure and the relationships between logically related tables.

 In ER modeling the database structure is represented as a diagram known as ER diagram (ERD).
 An ER diagram gives a better understanding of the overall database structure. 
 It becomes easier to map the tables, their keys, and relationships.

The ER diagram displays:

Table structure along with the column names and their data types
Primary and foreign key constraints
Relationship between tables

Following are the main components and its symbols in ER Diagrams:

Rectangles: This Entity Relationship Diagram symbol represents entity types
Ellipses : Symbol represent attributes
Diamonds: This symbol represents relationship types
Lines: It links attributes to entity types and entity types with other relationship types
Primary key: attributes are underlined
Double Ellipses: Represent multi-valued attributes


Components of the ER Diagram:

Entities
Attributes
Relationships
