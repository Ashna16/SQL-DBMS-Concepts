Defines the numerical attributes of the relationship between two entities or entity sets.

Different types of cardinal relationships are:

One-to-One Relationships
One-to-Many Relationships
May to One Relationships
Many-to-Many Relationships

1.One-to-one:

One entity from entity set X can be associated with at most one entity of entity set Y and vice versa.
Example: One student can register for numerous courses. However, all those courses have a single line back to that one student.

2.One-to-many:

One entity from entity set X can be associated with multiple entities of entity set Y, but an entity from entity set Y can be 
associated with at least one entity.
For example, one class is consisting of multiple students.

3. Many to One

More than one entity from entity set X can be associated with at most one entity of entity set Y. 
However, an entity from entity set Y may or may not be associated with more than one entity from entity set X.
For example, many students belong to the same class.

4. Many to Many:

One entity from X can be associated with more than one entity from Y and vice versa.
For example, Students as a group are associated with multiple faculty members, and faculty members can be associated with 
multiple students.
