The aggregate function simply refers to the calculations performed on a data set to get a single number that accurately represents 
the underlying data. The use of computers has improved how these calculations are performed, allowing aggregate functions to produce 
results very quickly and even adjust weightings based on the confidence the user has in the data.

Some common aggregate functions include:

Average (also called arithmetic mean)
Count
Maximum
Minimum
Range
NaNmean (the mean ignoring NaN values, also known as "nil" or "null")
Median
Mode
Sum

The symbol used to denote the aggregate function is G.
G sum (salary).
