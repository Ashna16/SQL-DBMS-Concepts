An intersection is defined by the symbol ∩

A ∩ B

Defines a relation consisting of a set of all tuple that are in both A and B. However, A and B must be union-compatible.


Example:

E1                   E2
ename               ename
Nisha               Akansha
Priya               Tiya
                    Priya


Query: π ename (E1)  ∩ π ename (E2)

Output: 
Priya
