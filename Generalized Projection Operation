1. It allows you to write the arithmetic function while writing you an expression.

2. The GENERALIZED PROJECTION operation is an extension to the PROJECTION operation.
In this case, arithmetic functions can be used in the projection list on certain attributes. The Generalized Projection has the form :

ΠF1, F2, ….. , Fn ( E )

Where E is a Relation Algebra Expression

F1, F2, F3…….Fn is an arithmetic expression.

For example :

How many more students can be there in a batch?

ΠBatchName, maxlimit – currentcount (Students)

Example-2:

Π slary*12 ^ (Emp)
