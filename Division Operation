It is an additional operation denoted by ÷.

When ÷ is used it divides the first relation by second relation,thereby eliminating similar attributes (columns) and giving 
the attributes which are present in first relation but not in second relation.

Example:


E1                                               E2
ename  dname                                    dname      city
