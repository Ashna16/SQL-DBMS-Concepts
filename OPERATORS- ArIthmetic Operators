We can use various Arithmetic Operators on the data stored in the tables.

Arithmetic Operators are:

+           [Addition]
-           [Subtraction]
/           [Division]
*           [Multiplication]
%           [Modulus]


Addition (+) :
It is used to perform addition operation on the data items, items include either single column or multiple columns.

Implementation:

SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary, salary + 100
   AS "salary + 100" FROM addition;

Here we have done addition of 100 to each Employee’s salary i.e, addition operation on single column.

Let’s perform addition of 2 columns:

SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary, salary + employee_id
   AS "salary + employee_id" FROM addition;

Subtraction (-) :
It is use to perform subtraction operation on the data items, items include either single column or multiple columns.

Implementation:

SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary, salary - 100
    AS "salary - 100" FROM subtraction;
    
   
Multiplication (*) :
    
It is use to perform multiplication of data items.

Implementation:

SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary, salary * 100
    AS "salary * 100" FROM addition;
    
Modulus ( % ) :

It is use to get remainder when one data is divided by another.

Implementation:

SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary, salary % 25000
    AS "salary % 25000" FROM addition;
    
    
Division

is typically required when you want to find out entities that are interacting with all entities of a set of different type entities.
The division operator is used when we have to evaluate queries which contain the keyword ‘all’.

Some instances where division operator is used are:

Which person has account in all the banks of a particular city?
Which students have taken all the courses required to graduate?
In all these queries, the description after the keyword ‘all’ defines a set which contains some elements and the final result contains those units who satisfy these requirements.

Important: Division is not supported by SQL implementations. However, it can be represented using other operations.(like cross join, Except, In )

SQL Implementation of Division

Given two relations(tables): R(x,y) , S(y).
R and S : tables
x and y : column of R
y : column of S

R(x,y) div S(y) means gives all distinct values of x from R that are associated with all values of y in S.

Implementation :

SELECT * FROM R 
WHERE x not in ( SELECT x FROM (
(SELECT x , y FROM (select y from S ) as p cross join 
(select distinct x from R) as sp)
EXCEPT
(SELECT x , y FROM R) ) AS r );
