There are several units that can be considered but only some are used such as:

SELECT Name, Extract(DAY FROM BirthTime) AS BirthDay FROM Test;

Output:
Name	BirthDay
Pratik	26
SELECT Name, Extract(YEAR FROM BirthTime) AS BirthYear FROM Test;

Output:
Name	BirthYear
Pratik	1996
SELECT Name, Extract(SECOND FROM BirthTime) AS BirthSecond FROM Test;

Output:
Name	BirthSecond
Pratik	581
