Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. 

There are two types of variables:
1. Free tuple variables
2. Bound tuple variable


1. Free tuple variable:
These variables are not qualified by there exists and for all.

2. Bound tuple variable:
This is qualified by some predicate or there exists or for all.
