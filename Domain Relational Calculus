Domain Relational Calculus is a non-procedural query language equivalent in power to Tuple Relational Calculus. 
Domain Relational Calculus provides only the description of the query but it does not provide the methods to solve it.
In Domain Relational Calculus, a query is expressed as,

{ < x1, x2, x3, ..., xn > | P (x1, x2, x3, ..., xn ) } 
where, < x1, x2, x3, …, xn > represents resulting domains variables and P (x1, x2, x3, …, xn ) represents the condition
or formula equivalent to the Predicate calculus.


Predicate Calculus Formula:

Set of all comparison operators
Set of connectives like and, or, not
Set of quantifiers

EXAMPLES:

Query-1: Find the loan number, branch, amount of loans of greater than or equal to 100 amount.

{≺l, b, a≻ | ≺l, b, a≻ ∈ loan ∧ (a ≥ 100)}


Query-2: Find the loan number for each loan of an amount greater or equal to 150.

{≺l≻ | ∃ b, a (≺l, b, a≻ ∈ loan ∧ (a ≥ 150)}


Query-3: Find the names of all customers having a loan at the “Main” branch and find the loan amount .

{≺c, a≻ | ∃ l (≺c, l≻ ∈ borrower ∧ ∃ b (≺l, b, a≻ ∈ loan ∧ (b = “Main”)))}
