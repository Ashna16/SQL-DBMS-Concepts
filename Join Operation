NATURAL JOIN (⋈)

Natural join can only be performed if there is a common attribute (column) between the relations. 
The name and type of the attribute must be same.

Example

Consider the following two tables

C

Num	         Square
2            	4
3	            9

D

Num	         Cube
2	            8
3            	27

Query: C ⋈ D

Output:
C ⋈ D

Num	        Square	          Cube
2	           4	               8
3	           9	               27
